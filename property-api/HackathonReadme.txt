Using the Property API during a Partner Hackathon

We use the production versions of our APIs in the hackathon for a number of good reasons. However, this also limits what we can allow partners to do with the property API. Production partners can use this API to onboard hotels, but, to avoid potential problems, hackathon participants are only allowed to update a pre-assigned hotel.

Hackathon participants should use a URL in the following form:

https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/properties/v1/test/<Your Assigned Provider PropertyID>

Replace <Your Assigned Provider PropertyID> with the Provider PropertyID provided by your Expedia coach.
